		<strong>Microsoft Power BI </strong>is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Microsoft Excel workbook, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, <strong>Power BI</strong>  lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
